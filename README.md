# VanillaHN
VanillaHN is a simple [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) client, built using only plain (vanilla) JavaScript—no frameworks involved.

The goal of this project is to become a [Baseline PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist#baseline), by using only plain (vanilla) JavaScript.

Once that is achieved, the goal is to take it a step further and become an [Exemplary PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist#exemplary), again, by using only plain (vanilla) JavaScript.
